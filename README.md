# Introducing: Travelta! ⛰️

 ### Travelta - a planner/travel organiser app, fully made by me in Kotlin. This was and still is a project to focus on learning Kotlin on my journey to become a better programmer. The idea for this app came to me after my family decided to travel to Italy in Summer 2025. _Although the app is launched as of February 20th 2025, updates still are and will be made._

## Use the app to create, edit, and keep track of your plans! Functionalities include:
### • Creating, editing and deleting plans
### • Setting reminders
### • Getting notifications
### • Searching for plans among those already created
### • And more in the future!

### _This app is Android only. Originally made for API 31_
